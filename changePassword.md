# Protecting from Account Theft
Hello,
if you were linked this message that means that your passwords and/or usernames have been stolen.
Having to change your passwords after your info getting stolen is complicated so I have tried to simplify it into a step-by-step format.

1. Before you take any action, if you still have the program which is stealing your information, uninstall it and delete it's files.
2. Identify what account's information would have been taken, you can do this by comparing dates you created certain accounts, and which devices you used those acounts on.
3. Once you find the accounts you think would have been effected, you have to start the process of changing all your passwords on those accounts, this change can be as little as adding an extra digit, however, you must make sure that your password changes.

And after you do all of these steps, you should start to be more cautious with files on third-party websites or with anonymous creators as many of them are viruses, some of which even worse than the one you experienced to the point where you permanently lose data.
I recommend putting sketchy files into irus scanner such as https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload from now on, to minimalize the risk of this happening again.

Thank you for anyone who follows these steps, and have a nice day.
